                                <p>Our latest tour featured one of the biggest attractions in New Orleans- the French Quarter. The French Quarter is the city’s historic heart, famous for its vibrant nightlife and colorful buildings with cast-iron balconies. Crowd-pleasing Bourbon Street features jazz clubs, Cajun eateries and raucous bars serving potent cocktails. Our tour of the French Quarter started at <span>Cafe Du Monde</span> where we had the New Orleans famous beignets with chicory coffee. It was a breakfast like no other- mouth- watering, deeply- fried, fluffy pieces of dough topped with powdered sugar (lots of it!), served with the extra- strong, slightly woody and nutty flavor of the <span title="woody, perennial herbaceous plant"> chicory </span> coffee, which, by the way, one can only find in New Orleans,- a mix of many cultures and <b>a true taste of Louisiana!</b> Cafe du Monde is a true New Orleans landmark and tourist destination, but also locals' favourite, located on Decatur Street right next to the mighty Mississippi river. Established in 1862, Cafe Du Monde is one of the oldest coffee stands in New Orleans, open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

                                <h3>St. Louis Cathedral</h3>
                                <p>In our next stop, we visited the St. Louis Cathedral- one of the biggest landmarks in the French Quarter. The Cathedral-Basilica of Saint Louis, King of France, also called St. Louis Cathedral (French: Cathédrale Saint-Louis, Roi-de-France, Spanish: Catedral de San Luis), is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans and is the oldest cathedral in continuous use in what would become the United States. It is dedicated to Saint Louis, also known as King Louis IX of France. The first church on the site was built in 1718; the third, under the Spanish rule, built in 1789, was raised to cathedral rank in 1793. The original St. Louis Cathedral was burned during the great fire of 1788 and was expanded and largely rebuilt and completed in the 1850s, with little of the 1789 structure remaining. Saint Louis Cathedral is located next to Jackson Square and facing the Mississippi River in the heart of New Orleans, situated between the historic buildings of the Cabildo and the Presbytère. It has been seen in hundreds of movies, TV shows and other visual presentations.</p>

                                    <h3>Bourbon Street</h3>
                                    <p>In our last stop, we toured the famous <em>Bourbon Street</em>. Bourbon Street <u>(French: Rue Bourbon, Spanish: Calle de Borbón)</u> is a historic street in the heart of the French Quarter of New Orleans. Extending thirteen blocks from Canal Street to Esplanade Avenue, Bourbon Street is famous for its many bars and strip clubs.<i> With 17.74 million visitors in 2017 alone, New Orleans depends on Bourbon Street as a main tourist attraction</i>, which provides a rich insight into New Orleans' past. If it is true that <q cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/new-orleans">America has only three cities: New York, San Francisco, and New Orleans</q>, then Bourbon Street is the soul of America.</p>
                                    <h4>The Funky Pirate Bar</h4>
                                    <p>During our tour of Bourbon Street, we visited "The Funky Pirate Bar" famous for its live jazz music and signature cocktail- <i>"Handgrenade"</i>. Rated 5 stars by Trip Advisor, a beloved filming location of popular tv shows such as True Blood and The Originals, The Funky Pirate Bar is one of the busiest bars in town and my personal favourite as well!</p>

There are only two things: love, all sorts of love, with pretty girls, and the music of New Orleans or Duke Ellington. Everything else ought to go, because everything else is ugly. I think New Orleans is such a beautiful city.

That's what the French Quarter is: it's a Creole community.

                            <blockquote cite="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1371846?ref=french-quarter">New Orleans is 5 feet below sea level, which means that holes dug in the ground immediately fill with water. Coffins were punctured and sunk with weights, which didn't stop them from floating up out of the cemeteries and down the streets of the French Quarter on stormy nights. The solution was to bury people above ground, in what are called vaults.
